    <h1>You wake up in a forest...</h1>

    <p>
      As you wake up after taking the red pill, you see yourself surrounded by trees, laying on grass with the sounds of silence surrounding you.
    </p>

    <p>
      You walk around the forest for what seems to be hours, trying to find a way out but no matter where you went, it all looked the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you continued walking, you stumbled across two diverging paths. 
    </p>

    <p>
     One path is all green while the other path is all pink.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which color path will you take?

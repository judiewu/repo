    <h1>RESTART</h1>

    <p>
      You chose to drink out of the orange cup.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, you returned to the original box. No doors or windows... No possible way out....
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, there is a grey metal table in front of you. As you approach the
      table, there are two pills on the table and a letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The letter reads:
    </p>

    <p>
      To whom it may concern,
    </p>

    <p>
      You are stuck in a box to test your strongest abilities. 
    </p>
      
    <p>  
      There is a blue pill and a red pill on the table that will lead to a different future...
      You will wake up in a different environment depending on you decision. 
    </p>  
     
    <p>
      Be wise on the decides you will make as it can help you escape the box, lead
      you to the same spot or to death.

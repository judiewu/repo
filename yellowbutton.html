    <h1>You are transported to a gold room...</h1>

    <p>
      As you walk around the room room, you notice it is empty except for a glass table.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you approach the glass table, you notice there are two cups, a white cup and a orange cup. 
    </p>

    <p>
      On the table there is also a note that reads:
    </p> 
    
    <p>
      To whom it may concern,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You have reached the end of your journey. Now it is time to make your final decision...
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are two cups on the table, a white cup and a orange cup. One will lead to a new journey and one will lead to your death.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Choose wisely

    <h1>You wake up on the beach...</h1>

    <p>
      As you awake after taking the blue pill, you realized you have been laying
      on the sand surrounded by rocks with the sounds of the waves crashing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You walk around the beach looking for someone or some exit off the beach
      but it is just an endless view of sand and water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Walking around for what it seems to be hours, you stumble across two
      unqiue color rocks. One is yellow and the other is purple.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you inspect the rocks closer, you see that they are not rocks but
      rather two buttons both containing the words "press me to escape"
    </p>

    <p>
      Which button do you press?
    </p>
